	since: 1.0

	desc:
		Makes Endermen not make their growling or screeching sounds when angry.
		
		On client, mutes the sounds for just you. This means angry endermen don't make ambient
		sounds.

		stare sound is client-sided, unfortunately.

	name: Disable Equip Sound
	since: 1.0

	desc:

		glitchily played every tick. Armor equip sounds and other custom equip sounds remain
		unchanged. You won't even notice it's gone.
		
		On client, mutes it just for you.
		
		On server, prevents the sound from playing at all for everyone.
